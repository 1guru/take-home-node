# Take Home Project

Build a simple todo list ordered alphabetically. We've allotted 2 hours to finish this project. If you have not completed the project in that time, we ask that you submit the code you have. This will better help us evaluate your proficiency and will ultimately help us ensure that we're a good fit for you and that you're a good fit for us.

## Project Requirements

- List out all todo items alphabetically
- A user should be able to edit a todo item.
- All items, and any related state, should persist upon reload.
- Code should pass lint checks and get auto formatted with prettier settings.

## Development

- To start the dev server run `npm start` which will concurrently run the back-end and front-end.
- The back-end runs on port 4000 and the front-end runs on port 4200.

## Dependencies

- This app uses [knexjs](http://knexjs.org/) for interacting with the database. It has been setup to use sqlite, and no configuration is needed.
- Typescript
- Angular 9
- We've included [material](https://material.angular.io/), in case you have extra time and want to add a little extra pop to the app.
